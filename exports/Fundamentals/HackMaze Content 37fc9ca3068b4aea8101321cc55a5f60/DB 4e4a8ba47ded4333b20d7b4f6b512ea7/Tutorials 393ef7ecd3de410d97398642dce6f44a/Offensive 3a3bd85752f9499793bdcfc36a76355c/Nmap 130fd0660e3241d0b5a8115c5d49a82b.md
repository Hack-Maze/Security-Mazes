## Information

- nmap scans
    1. ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts ( if you and the target are in the same subnet) because arp can’t be routed 
        1. ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts
        2. TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.

## Nmap Port Scan types (12)

- How to detect IDS and IPS
    - `IDS systems` alone are usually there to help administrators detect potential attacks on their network. They can then decide how to handle such connections. We can trigger certain security measures from an administrator, for example, by aggressively scanning a single port and its service. Based on whether specific security measures are taken, we can detect if the network has some monitoring applications or not.
    - One method to determine whether such `IPS system` is present in the target network is to scan from a single host (`VPS`). If at any time this host is blocked and has no access to the target network, we know that the administrator has taken some security measures. Accordingly, we can continue our penetration test with another `VPS`.
        - [you can use Decoys](Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b.md)
- [How to detect firewalls](Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b.md)
- port state:
    
    There are a total of 6 different states for a scanned port we can obtain:
    
    | State | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | open | This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be TCP connections, UDP datagrams as well as SCTP associations. |
    | closed | When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an RST flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not. |
    | filtered | Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target. |
    | unfiltered | This state of a port only occurs during the Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b.md scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed. |
    | open|filtered | If we do not get a response for a specific port, Nmap will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port. |
    | closed|filtered | This state only occurs in theNmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b.mdNmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b.mdNmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b.mdscans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall. |
- Scan types: -s**UPPERCASE_**LETTER
    - Null, Fin, Xmas On scenario where these three scan types can be efficient is when scanning a target behind a stateless (non-stateful) firewall. A stateless firewall will check if the incoming packet has the SYN flag set to detect a connection attempt. Using a flag combination that does not match the SYN packet makes it possible to deceive the firewall and reach the system behind it. However, a stateful firewall will practically block all such crafted packets and render this kind of scan useless.
    - `-sN` → Null scan
    - `-sF` → Fin scan
        
        ![Untitled](Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - `-sX` → Xmas scan
        
        ![Untitled](Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - `-sT` → perform a TCP connection port scan   It is important to note that if you are not a privileged user (root or sudoer), a TCP connect scan is the only possible option to discover open TCP ports.
        
        ![Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b/Screenshot_from_2021-07-10_11-25-12.png](Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b/Screenshot_from_2021-07-10_11-25-12.png)
        
    - `-sU` → UDP port scan → slower than TCP
    - `-sS` → perform a SYN scan
        
        ![Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b/Screenshot_from_2021-07-10_11-26-10.png](Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b/Screenshot_from_2021-07-10_11-26-10.png)
        
    - `-sV` → perform a version detection scan 
    This isn't stealthy but very useful
        - **`--version-intensity LEVEL`  0-9**
        - It is important to note that using `-sV` will force Nmap to proceed with the TCP 3-way handshake and establish the connection. The connection establishment is necessary because Nmap cannot discover the version without establishing a connection fully and communicating with the listening service. In other words, stealth SYN scan `-sS`
         is not possible when `-sV` option is chose
    - `-sA` → start the scan with ACK (check the firewall not check the port )
        - without a firewall
        
        ```bash
        pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sA 10.10.119.125
        
        Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-30 10:37 BST
        Nmap scan report for 10.10.119.125
        Host is up (0.0013s latency).
        All 1000 scanned ports on MACHINE_IP are unfiltered
        MAC Address: 02:45:BF:8A:2D:6B (Unknown)
        
        Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.68 seconds
        ```
        
        - with a firewall we have three ports that aren't being blocked by the firewall. This result indicates that the firewall is blocking all other ports except for these three ports.
        
        ```bash
        pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sA 10.10.119.125
        
        Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-07 11:34 BST
        Nmap scan report for 10.10.119.125
        Host is up (0.00046s latency).
        Not shown: 997 filtered ports
        PORT    STATE      SERVICE
        22/tcp  unfiltered ssh
        25/tcp  unfiltered smtp
        80/tcp  unfiltered http
        MAC Address: 02:78:C0:D0:4E:E9 (Unknown)
        
        Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 15.45 seconds
        ```
        
    - `-sW`
        - On Windows, use an unfiltered ports with other scan types such as Window scan, SYN scan, or FIN scan, may help resolve whether the port is open.
        - Finally, it is essential to note that the ACK scan and the window scan were very efficient at helping us map out the firewall rules. However, it is vital to remember that just because a firewall is not blocking a specific port, it does not necessarily mean that a service is listening on that port. For example, there is a possibility that the firewall rules need to be updated to reflect recent service changes. Hence, ACK and window scans are exposing the firewall rules, not the services.
    - `--scanflag RSTFINURG` Custom scan
    - `-sI`  → Idle/Zombie scan
    - `-sC` → Default nmap script engine scan 
    **`--script=default`**
    - `-sM` → Maimon Scan. This scan won’t work on most targets encountered in modern networks

## Output Formats (5)

- `-oN` file_name→ store in normal format
- `-oG` file_name → store output in greppable format, one line per host
- `-oX` file_name → store output in XML format → important : you can  import this file to metasploit
- `-oS` file_name → store the output in script kiddie format
- `-oA` file_name → store the output in many formats

---

## Runtime Interaction (3)

- p → turn on packet tracing
- v → inrease verbosity
- d → increase debugging level

---

## Nmap speed (13)

- To avoid IDS alerts, you might consider `-T0` or `-T1`. For instance, `-T0` scans one port at a time and waits 5 minutes between sending each probe, so you can guess how long scanning one target would take to finish.
- `-T0` : paranoid (very slow)
- `-T1` : sneaky
- `-T2` : polite
- `-T3` : normal
- `-T4` : aggressive
- `-T5` : insane
- `-F`: Fast mode - Scan fewer ports than the default scan
- `--min-rate <number>` minimum number of packets is <number> per second
- `--max-rate <number>` maximum number of packets is <number> per second
- `--min-parallelism <numprobes>`
- `--max-parallelism <numprobes>`
- `--scan-delay`
- `--max-scan-delay <time>`
- `--stats-every=5s`

---

## OS fingerprinting (3)

- `-O` → Enable Operating System detection 
`--osscan-limit` : limit OS  detection to promising targets
`--osscan-guess` : Guess OS more aggressively

---

## --script=category

- **`--script-trace`**
- **`nmap --script-help <script-name>`**

[Scripts categories](Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b/Scripts%20categories%200e23074739db419a815ae17644c8ed21.csv)

## Spoofing (IP, MAC, and Decoys) (3)

<aside>
💡 IP

- **`nmap -S SpoofingIP Target`**
- If you try to scan a target from some random network using a spoofed IP address, chances are you won’t have any response routed to you, and the scan results could be unreliable.
- For this scan to work and give accurate results, the attacker needs to monitor the network traffic to analyze the replies.
1. Attacker sends a packet with a spoofed source IP address to the target machine.
2. Target machine replies to the spoofed IP address as the destination.
3. Attacker captures the replies to figure out open ports.

<aside>
💡 MAC

- `--spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC`. This address spoofing is only possible if the attacker and the target machine are on the same Ethernet (802.3) network or same WiFi (802.11).
</aside>

---

<aside>
💡 Decoys

- **`nmap -D Decoy1,Decoy2,Attacker,Decoy3 Target`**
- **`nmap -D RND:5 Target`**
    - RND ⇒ nmap will assign this address randomly
        
        ![Untitled](Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b/Untitled%208.png)
        
        ![Untitled](Nmap%20130fd0660e3241d0b5a8115c5d49a82b/Untitled%209.png)
        

Decoys can be used for SYN, ACK, ICMP scans, and OS detection scans.

## **various options**

- -f , --mtu <val>: fragment packets (optionally w/given MTU) bypass some firewalls ( MTU: Maximum Transmission Unit)
- --exclude IP
- **`--reason`**
- **`--traceroute`**
    - Note that Nmap’s traceroute works slightly different than the `traceroute` command found on Linux and macOS or `tracert` found on MS Windows. Standard `traceroute` starts with a packet of low TTL (Time to Live) and keeps increasing until it reaches the target. Nmap’s traceroute starts with a packet of high TTL and keeps decreasing it.
    - It is worth mentioning that many routers are configured not to send ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded, which would prevent us from discovering their IP addresses. For more information, visit the [Active Reconnaissance](https://tryhackme.com/room/activerecon) room.
- -n IP : don't do address resolution (DNS)
- `-R`  always do dns resolution (default sometimes)
- -iL <input file, file contains the inputs>input List
- -- top-ports <number >
- `--max-retries` <1→50>
- `--dns-server <ns>,<ns>`). This method could be fundamental to us if we are in a demilitarized zone (`DMZ`). The company's DNS servers are usually more trusted than those from the Internet
- `--source-port` for our scans. If the administrator uses the firewall to control this port and does not filter IDS/IPS properly, our TCP packets will be trusted and passed through.
- -p <port number, ...>
 start number-end number
`nmap -p-n taurget` means from 1 to n 
nmap -p- target means from 1 to 65535
- -A = (-sT -O -sC --traceroute ) aggressive scan  Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute ,to find out what  is the service runs with this port  , tcprapped → cann't determine the service
- **`sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse [https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/](https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/)<script-name>.nse`**
- -r: Scan ports consecutively - don't randomize This option is useful when testing whether ports open in a consistent manner, for instance, when a target boots up.
