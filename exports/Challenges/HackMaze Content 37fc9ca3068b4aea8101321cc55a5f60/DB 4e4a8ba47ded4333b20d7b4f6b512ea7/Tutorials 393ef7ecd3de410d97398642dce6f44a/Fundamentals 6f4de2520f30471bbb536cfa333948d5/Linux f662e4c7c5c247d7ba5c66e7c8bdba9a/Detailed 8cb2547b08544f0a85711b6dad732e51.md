# Users and Groups

Understanding users and groups is fundamental to managing a Linux system effectively. Let's delve into the details.

## Users

Linux is built to support multiple users simultaneously. Each user has their own unique identity within the system. This identity consists of:

- **Username**: A human-readable name for identification.
- **User ID (UID)**: A numeric value assigned to each user for internal system identification.
- **Home directory**: A dedicated space where a user's files and settings are stored, ensuring privacy and individual customization.

## Groups

Groups in Linux allow for efficient management of permissions and access control. Here's what you need to know:

- **Privilege levels**: Groups can be thought of as levels of privilege. Users belonging to a group can access or modify files associated with that group, based on file permissions.
- **Enhanced collaboration**: Groups facilitate collaboration among users by providing shared access to specific resources.

# Understanding IDs

Every user and group in Linux is associated with a unique identifier. Let's explore the significance of these identifiers.

## User IDs (UIDs)

User IDs serve as the primary means of identifying users within a Linux system. Here's a breakdown:

- **Root privileges**: The superuser, with UID 0, possesses the highest level of system privileges.
- **System accounts**: IDs ranging from 1 to 200 are typically reserved for main system accounts, integral to system operations.
- **Normal users**: IDs from 1000 onwards are allocated to regular users upon creation.

## Group IDs (GIDs)

Group IDs are essential for managing access rights and permissions. Here's a brief overview:

- **Efficient resource management**: GIDs streamline permission allocation by grouping users with similar access requirements.
- **Access control**: By assigning users to specific groups, administrators can regulate access to files and directories effectively.

# User Management

Managing users and groups involves a variety of tasks, from creating and deleting users to setting permissions. Let's explore these operations in detail.

## Creating Users

To add a new user to the system, the `useradd` command is used:

```bash
sudo useradd [user name]

```

Remember to use `sudo` to execute commands with administrative privileges.

## Setting or Changing User Passwords

To set or change a user's password, the `passwd` command is employed:

```bash
sudo passwd [user name]

```

This command prompts you to enter a new password for the specified user.

## Deleting Users

Removing a user from the system can be accomplished using the `userdel` command:

```bash
sudo userdel [user name]

```

This command deletes the specified user account from the system.
